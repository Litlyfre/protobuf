Overview
--------

Protocol Buffers (a.k.a., protobuf) are Google's language-neutral,
platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. You
can learn more about it in [protobuf's documentation](https://protobuf.dev).

This README file contains protobuf installation instructions. To install
protobuf, you need to install the protocol compiler (used to compile .proto
files) and the protobuf runtime for your chosen programming language.

Working With Protobuf Source Code
---------------------------------

Most users will find working from
[supported releases](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases) to be
the easiest path.

If you choose to work from the head revision of the main branch your build will
occasionally be broken by source-incompatible changes and insufficiently-tested
(and therefore broken) behavior.

If you are using C++ or otherwise need to build protobuf from source as a part
of your project, you should pin to a release commit on a release branch.

This is because even release branches can experience some instability in between
release commits.

Protobuf Compiler Installation
------------------------------

The protobuf compileris written in C++. If you are using C++, please follow
the [C++ Installation Instructions](src/README.md) to install protoc along
with the C++ runtime.

For non-C++ users, the simplest way to install the protocol compiler is to
download a pre-built binary from our [GitHub release page](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases).

In the downloads section of each release, you can
